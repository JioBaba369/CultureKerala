                <h3>Events &amp; Ticketing.</h3>
                <p>
                    Events and ticketing may be provided by organizers or third‑party platforms (e.g., Stripe/Checkout). DilSePass is <strong>not</strong> the seller for third‑party tickets. Organizer terms, refund, and entry policies apply.

                </p>
                <h3>Verification Badges.</h3>
                <p>
                    A badge indicates a basic vetting/identity check but is <strong>not</strong> an endorsement or warranty.
                </p>
                <h3>Maps/Location.</h3>
                <p>

                </p>

                <h2>8. Moderation &amp; Enforcement</h2>
                <p>
                    We may (but are not obligated to) monitor, edit, refuse, or remove content; suspend features; and restrict or terminate accounts, to protect users and comply with laws. We may preserve and disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights or users.
                </p>

                <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>
                    The Service, including logos, branding, design, text, software, and other materials, is owned by DilSePass or its licensors and protected by IP laws. Except as expressly allowed, you may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the Service.
                </p>

                <h2>10. Feedback</h2>
                <p>
                    If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free license to use it without restriction or obligation.
                </p>

                <h2>11. Third‑Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    The Service may link to or integrate with third‑party services (e.g., Google Maps, Stripe, SendGrid, Algolia, Firebase, GA4). We are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of them is governed by their terms and privacy policies.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Payments, Fees &amp; Taxes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fees may apply for tickets, promoted placements, or subscriptions. Taxes are your responsibility unless the law requires us to collect.</li>
                    <li>Chargebacks, refunds, and cancellations follow organizer or payment‑provider rules.</li>
                    <li>We may change prices or introduce new fees with notice as required by law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>13. Disclaimers</h2>
                <p>
                    The Service is provided on an <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong> basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, DilSePass disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, non‑infringement, and non‑interference. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation or that content will be accurate or complete.
                </p>

                <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, DilSePass and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents will <strong>not</strong> be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses. Our aggregate liability for any claim will not exceed the greater of <strong>AUD $100</strong> or the amount you paid to us for the Service in the <strong>12 months</strong> prior to the event giving rise to the claim. Nothing limits liability that cannot be excluded by law (e.g., consumer guarantees under Australian law).
                </p>

                <h2>15. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>
                    You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless DilSePass from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from or related to your use of the Service, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or laws.
                </p>

                <h2>16. Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive termination.
                </p>

                <h2>17. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    We may modify the Service or these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., in‑app or by email). The updated Terms take effect on the stated date. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.
                </p>

                <h2>18. Governing Law &amp; Disputes</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>New South Wales, Australia</strong>. You and DilSePass submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales. If you are a consumer in a country with mandatory local consumer protection laws, those laws may provide you additional rights.
                </p>
