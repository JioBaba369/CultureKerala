# Culture Kerala â€” Connecting the Global Malayali Diaspora

**Culture Kerala** is the digital home for Malayalis everywhereâ€”a single place to discover what's happening, who's nearby, and how to stay rooted in Kerala's culture no matter where you live. Our mission is simple: bridge distance, celebrate heritage, and make community effortless.

## ðŸš€ New Architecture (2024)

This project has been completely restructured using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with modern technologies:

- **Domain-Driven Architecture** - Organized by business domains (events, groups, businesses, auth, users)
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** - Type-safe database layer replacing Firebase Firestore
- **Next.js 14** - App Router with TypeScript
- **Modern Tooling** - ESLint, Prettier, comprehensive testing

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## What You'll Find

* **All-in-One Global Directory**
  A unified, curated hub for **Events**, **Communities**, **Businesses**, **Deals**, and **Malayalam Movies**â€”local to you and across the world. Explore confidently with clear categories and up-to-date listings.

* **Powerful, Intent-Based Search**
  Find exactly what you need in seconds. Search by **location**, **category**, and **keywords** (e.g., "Sydney + Onam + family"), then refine with smart filters for precision resultsâ€”whether it's an authentic eatery or this weekend's cultural gathering.

* **Personalized Profiles & Feeds**
  Tell us your interests and we'll surface what matters. **Save** events, communities, deals, and movies to your profile; your **personal feed** highlights new and relevant releases as they appear.

* **Seamless Saving & Sharing**
  Build community with one tap. Save discoveries to revisit later, or share them instantly via a **share modal** that generates a **scannable QR code** and a **direct link** ready for WhatsApp, Instagram, or email.

* **Safety First: Reporting & Moderation**
  We keep the platform respectful and trustworthy. Users can **flag content** in a tap; reports flow into a **moderation queue** for review in a secure **admin console**. Clear policies and approvals protect quality and integrity.

## Why It's Different

* **Unified**: Everything Malayaliâ€”events to moviesâ€”under one roof.
* **Relevant**: A feed tuned to your interests and location.
* **Effortless**: Save, share, and show upâ€”no chasing links or scattered posts.
* **Trustworthy**: Community reporting and human moderation keep standards high.
