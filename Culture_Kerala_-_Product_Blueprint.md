Culture Kerala: Connecting the Global Diaspora

Culture Kerala is the definitive digital home for the worldwide Kerala diaspora. It is designed as a central hub for community connection, cultural discovery, and shared experiences. Our mission is to bridge the geographical distance and bring the rich, vibrant culture of Kerala to every corner of the globe.

## Core Features

### Centralized Global Directory
Serving as a unified platform, our dynamic directory is the central hub for discovering the global Kerala diaspora. Users can effortlessly browse a wide array of curated content, including local and global Events, vibrant Communities, trusted Businesses, exclusive Deals, and the latest Malayalam Movies.

### Intuitive Advanced Search
Our intuitive search engine allows you to find content with pinpoint accuracy. Go beyond basic keywords by combining filters like location, category, and other keywords to get highly specific results, ensuring you quickly discover the most relevant content, whether it's an authentic restaurant or a community gathering.

### Personalized User Profiles
Each user gets a personalized profile to curate their experience. You can save items of interest—such as events, communities, deals, and movies—for easy access later. Your personalized feed will also highlight content that aligns with your specified interests, making your experience truly unique.

### Seamless Saving & Sharing
Building community is simple with our integrated sharing tools. Users can effortlessly save items to their profile and share discoveries with their network using our dedicated share modal. Each share generates a scannable QR code for immediate access and a direct link for easy sharing across all platforms.

### Robust Reporting & Moderation
We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment. Our platform includes a streamlined reporting system that allows users to flag inappropriate content, which is immediately sent to a moderation queue.

## Design & Visual Identity
The visual identity of Culture Kerala is a fusion of heritage and modernity, built on a bold, high-contrast palette and contemporary typography. This approach creates a user experience that is both sophisticated and inviting.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: A vibrant Green
- **Background**: The app features a dynamic background that adapts to user preference. A soft, neutral Warm Gray (#F4F3EF) serves as the backdrop in light mode, while a rich Indigo (#4b0082) provides a sophisticated feel and excellent readability in dark mode.
- **Accent**: A bold Blue (#0000FF) provides strong visual contrast, adding a modern and reliable touch to interactive elements.

### Typography
- **Body Font**: We use 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font known for its modern feel and exceptional readability across all content.
- **Headline Font**: 'Space Grotesk' is our choice for headers and titles, offering a contemporary, tech-inspired look that captures attention.

### Icons & Animations
- **Icons**: We maintain a unified visual language with the consistent use of lucide-react icons throughout the platform.
- **Animations**: Subtle Framer Motion animations with a duration of 200-300ms are used for UI transitions. These are designed to be fluid and responsive, while also respecting accessibility by adhering to prefers-reduced-motion settings.
